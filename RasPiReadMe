This is a link to an image of the Raspberry Pi used on the hex copter.

The image can be written to a 32GB SD card using Win32Imager, which was used to create the image.

The Raspberry Pi starts logging GPS data and scanning using the rtlsdr receiver around 2 minutes after boot up.
A USB drive will need to be attached to have the data logged to it. The Pi is set to auto mount the USB drive.
The GPS data comes from a USB GPS device that will be plugged in. I am not sure if any USB GPS will work or if it is setup specifically for the one I have.
But it is based on the uBlox M7 or M8 gps chip.
